# Places database management

POIs are created and managed in the Places database. This can be done using APIs, or using our product interface. 

Geofences are a type of POI and are defined in the database based on the following keys:

| Keys | Description | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ID | Unique identifier assigned to each POI | Yes |
| Name | Friendly Name given to the POI | Yes |
| Library | Each POI must be assigned a library for organization | Yes |
| Icon | Assist with visualizations of the POIs | Yes \(assigned default\) |
| Color | Assist with visualizations of the POIs | Yes \(assigned default\) |
| Category | Assign a common framework of categories that are common across all POIs in all libraries | No |
| Address | Street address | No |
| City | city of POI | No |
| State/Region | state or region of POI | No |
| Country | country of POI | No |
| Latitude | Latitude coordinate for center of POI | Yes |
| Longitude | Longitude coordinate for center of POI | Yes |
| Metadata | custom key + value pairs that can be assigned to POIs. This metadata streamlines future workflows by allowing you to group POIs across libraries for each to use rules and filters in downstream workflows such as send a push notification whenever someone enter a POI with Type = Competitor. | No |
