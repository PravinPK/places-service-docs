# Understanding POIs

We provide generic CRUD APIs, can be used to edit/delete POIs/libraries one at a time. We also provide batchUpdate/batchDelete. Must know the POIsâ€™ uniqueID to update/delete them Can use batchUpdate to move POIs from 1 lib to another. If a library is deleted, all of its POIs are also deleted. Be careful.
