# Overview

For example, you can send a personalized notification when user enters one of your stores, send link to a satisfaction survey _x_ hours after this user visited one of your stores in San Francisco, and so on. 

Here is the general workflow to start using Place...

1. Import your Points of Interest \(POI\).
2. Create rules to use the POIs as conditions in Adobe Launch.
3. Publish to the SDK.
